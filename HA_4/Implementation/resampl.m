% resampled particles.

%   if old particle vector is x, new particles x_new is computed as x(:,j)

% Input:
%   X   [n x N] Particles, each column is a particle.
%   W   [1 x N] Weights, corresponding to the samples
%
% Output:
%   Xr  [n x N] Resampled particles, each corresponding to some particle 
%               from old weights.
%   Wr  [1 x N] New weights for the resampled particles.
%   j   [1 x N] vector of indices refering to vector of old particles
